# SitcomIRL
SitcomIRL is a smart phone app written in React-Native and available through Expo. Hopefully it'll be available by other means when I learn more.

## Modifying
Don't like the sounds I chose or want to expand it?

    npm i -G create-react-native-app
    git clone https://github.com/crashspringfield/SitcomIRL.git
    yarn install && yarn start
