# SitcomIRL
SitcomIRL is a smart phone app written in React-Native and available through Expo. Hopefully it'll be available by other means when I learn more.

Download the Expo app on your phone and visit [https://expo.io/@crashspringfield/sitcomirl](https://expo.io/@crashspringfield/sitcomirl) to scan the QR code.
